## what is gust?

gust is a simple helper for tailwind that allows you to enter
pixel values and get the equivalent name in the tailwind spacing
scale. if a pixel value does not exist in the default tailwind
spacing scale, gust provides you with the name and rem value that
you can add to your tailwind config and use straight away.

## why?

i mainly built this for myself to use at work -- I often have to go through the flow of 1) converting px values to rem, 2) finding the corresponding name in tailwind 3) and maybe needing to add a new spacing entry to the tailwind config 😶‍🌫️

this app shows you all the necessary steps on one page 🤝

that's it. lol
